SAEMI is a tool for obtaining a Size Analysis of particles in Electron Microscopy Images. To obtain a size analysis,
first upload an Electron Microscopy image using the Upload button below. The tool will then predict how to segment the
particles from the background using a model trained through deep learning. After segmentation, the tool will label each
separate segment and count each segment's number of pixels. This size distribution is then displayed in a histogram which
can be used to determine properties such as the mean size, median size or standard deviation of sizes in the image.
Thank you for considering using this tool and any additional feedback is always welcome. Good luck!
