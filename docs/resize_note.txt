NOTE: For the model to predict the image segments, 
      the image has to be rescaled to 192x256 pixels. 
      This is done using bilinear interpolation. 
      The sizes displayed in the histogram above are 
      actually the number of pixels calculated from 
      the 192x256 prediction multiplied by the rescaling 
      factor.
