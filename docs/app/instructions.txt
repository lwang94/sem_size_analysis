SAEMI is a tool for obtaining a Size Analysis of particles in Electron Microscopy Images. To obtain a size analysis,
first upload an Electron Microscopy image using the Upload Image button below. The size distribution will then be displayed in a histogram 
and can be downloaded as a .csv by clicking on Download Data. Please note that for the best results, the image should have minimal noise and 
measurement artifacts. Watermarks and additional meta information (such as the scale bar) should also be removed from the image as it may be 
mislabeled as a particle (stay tuned for image preprocessing tools in the next version!) Thank you for considering using this tool and any 
additional feedback is always welcome. Good luck!
