# SEM Size Analysis

SAEMI is a tool for obtaining a Size Analysis of particles in Electron Microscopy Images. It uses an image segmentation model 
trained through a neural network to detect (nano)particle sizes and locations. From there, it then obtains a histogram of the 
sizes of each particle, providing important information such as mean particle size, median particle size etc. This tool can be 
used for characterizing new materials, analyzing environmental effects on chemical systems, ensure quality control for routine 
synthesis and much more.
